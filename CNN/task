1. For the “ CIFAR10 small image classification ” from the Keras library,
propose and implement the splitting of these data for training data and test
data in a ratio of 3 to 7,
2. Based on the convolutional network,
according to the teacher’s instructions, propose a classifier,
which classifies two of ten classes,
3. Suggest a classifier with one, two and three convolution layers,4.
Compare the results from the previous point and suggest the optimal
classifier for the given problem.
