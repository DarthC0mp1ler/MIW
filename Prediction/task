propose and implement the division of this data into training dat aand test data,
2. Suggest a linear autoregressive model (AR model) that takes into
account several previous company quotes (not more than50).
Specify model parameters using the least squares method.
Verify the correctness of the model,
3. Suggest recurrent neural network for quotation prediction.
Train the network (use the techniques of network training known to you as abandonment, scaling etc.).
Verify the correctness of the model,
4. For quotation prediction, use additional data (e.g., volume or WIG),
5. Compare AR models and recursive neural networks
